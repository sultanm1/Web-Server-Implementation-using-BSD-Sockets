# Web-Server-Implementation-using-BSD-Sockets

Implement a “Web Server” by responding to client’s HTTP request. The “Web Server” should parse the HTTP request from the client, creates an HTTP response message consisting of the requested file preceded by header lines, then sends the response directly to the client. In order to test it, you should first start your Web server, and then initiate a Web client. For example, you may open Mozilla Firefox and connect to your Web server.
